    <h2>A message from the developer, Philip Nguyen.</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I set out on this project with a few goals in mind. The goals are listed below, although not in any particular order or priority. </p>

  <p>The first goal is to make a messaging platform
      to keep communication in one place, where we could all remain in contact with each other, share ideas, or ask questions,
       without having to dance and tangle with Twitter, Facebook, etc..., because I realize
      that not everyone has or wants to use the aforementioned services.
  </p>
    <p>The second goal is to reduce complexity and introduce simplicity.
       I love Emails, but I feel that it does present some complexity, especially
       when more than 3 people start sending
    messages to each other, thus creating a messy spider web of messages.</p>

    <p>The third goal is to create something useful for the users, tailored to their needs. There are many messaging, chats, bulletin boards, and forums out there.
      I've tried many of them and found that they are great,
    but they also miss a few features. They are either too simple or too complex. Creating this application from scratch gives me a chance
    to create for <em>you</em>.</p>
    <p>I am always looking for feedback. I'd love to
      hear what you have to say, but keep in mind I won't be able to implement certain feature request
      due to time constraint. I will work on this application, piece by piece, much like a brick layer lays brick.
      Ultimately, in the end, what I hope and envision for the end goal of this project is to have something that <strong>we</strong> created together.
    </p>

    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Philip Nguyen</p>
