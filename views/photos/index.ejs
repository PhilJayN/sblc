    <h2>A message from the developer</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>I set out on this project with a few objectives in mind. The goals are listed below, although not in any particular order or priority. </p>

  <p>The first goal is to make a messaging platform
      to keep communication in one place, where we can all remain in contact with each other, share ideas, or ask questions,
       without having to dance and tangle with Twitter, Facebook, etc. I realize
      that not everyone has or wants to use the aforementioned services.
  </p>
    <p>The second goal is to reduce complexity and introduce simplicity.
       I love emails, but I feel that it does present some complexity, especially
       when more than 3 people send
    messages to each other.</p>

    <p>The third goal is to create something useful for the users, tailored to their needs.
      Creating this application from scratch gives me a chance
    to produce and customize for <em>you</em>.</p>
    <p>Finally, I am always looking for feedback and suggestions! I'd love to
      hear what you have to say. However, I won't be able to implement certain feature request
      due to time constraint. I will work on this application, piece by piece, much like a brick layer lays brick.
      Ultimately, in the end, what I hope and envision for the end goal of this project is to have something useful that <strong>we</strong> created together.
    </p>

    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Philip Nguyen</p>


    <p>P.S.</p>

  <p>Please keep in mind that comments that you post might be deleted as I maintain and

  <h2>Feedback and Suggestions</h2>
  <p>I'm open to all suggestion and feedback! Right now my main struggle is the user interface, mainly
  on improving the look, feel, and user experience of the app. If you have an artistic eye, or know of
someone who has a background in UI/UX, let me know! Even if you don't have experience, I'd love to hear
from you because I'm confident you have better eyes than I do!</p>
